ASICS men's HOCKEY TYPHOON hockey shoe
Step out on to the pitch with confidence in the HOCKEY TYPHOON hockey shoe for men by ASICS, carefully designed to help players with the unique challenges of the game.
The HOCKEY TYPHOON shoe has a springy midsole and some clever tech to help prevent twisting while running.
Different types of cushioning and support in the HOCKEY TYPHOON shoe will really put a bounce in your run.
The SOLYTE ™ midsole is a special cushioning material that is not just extra lightweight, it also has excellent bounce-back properties and is durable too.
This shoe also features GEL ™ technology in the fore and rearfoot that will cushion your landing from each stride.
This silicone material has great shock absorbency properties and is built into parts of the sole where it can best do its work.
Hockey is a game in which players need to make rapid changes in direction, so the HOCKEY TYPHOON shoe has design features to help keep you stable.
DUOMAX ™ technology in the midsole consists of two different density materials designed to control "overpronation" - the tendency of the foot to roll inwards when running.
The TRUSSTIC SYSTEM ™ technology - a molded component under the mid-foot - will also help with that all-important stability.
Hot and sweaty feet can be very uncomfortable and slow you down, so there's an ORTHOLITE ™ insole for moisture management, while the removable EVA sockliner provides an extra flexible support option.
And, because you want you shoe to last, it has a hard-wearing rubber outsole.
With a contemporary design and technical features, you can go out and give the game your al with the HOCKY TYPHOON hockey shoe.
